# macaulay-plotter-py
A Python program that plots the shear force graph and the bending moment of an equation given in Macaulay's notation. This script uses the `sympy` library, a library for symbolic mathematics and physics.

## Prerequsuites 
Requires `sympy`, which can be installed with `pip install sympy`.

## Operation
Run the script with `py macaulay2.py`. The program will then walk you through the steps required before the graphs can be plotted.

## Todo
Add support for tension, torsion, slope, displacement, and Von Misces stress.
