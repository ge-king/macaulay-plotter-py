A Python program that plots the shear force graph and the bending moment of an equation given in Macaulay's notation. This script uses the amazing *sympy* library, a library for symbolic mathematics and physics.

## Prerequsuites 
Requires *sympy*, which can be installed with *pip install sympy*.

## Operation
Run the script with *py macaulay2.py*. The program will then walk you through the steps required before the graphs can be plotted.
